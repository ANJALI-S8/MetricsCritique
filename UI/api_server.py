"""
Serves the dashboard's static files AND a read-only drill-down API.

Every clickable element in the UI (a topic bar, an entity name, a risk/theme
card, an alert row, a platform panel...) calls GET /api/drill here instead of
anything being preloaded into browser memory up front. Each call:
  - opens a short-lived cursor against the existing read-only connection
  - runs exactly one bounded (LIMIT-capped) query selecting only the columns
    that view needs
  - returns JSON and is done -- nothing is cached or accumulated server-side
    between requests, and the browser discards the rows when the drill panel
    is closed. Memory use is "one query's worth of rows", not "the corpus".
  - also attaches a small `related` block (co-occurring entities/categories/
    topics + a few similar posts) computed the same way -- see compute_related().

Usage:
    cd UI && ../.venv/bin/python3 api_server.py [port]   # default 8877
