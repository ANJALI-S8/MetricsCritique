# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## What this is

A read-only OSINT analytics pipeline over the live `shaktidb_social` Postgres corpus:
extract → NLP/ontology → statistically gated metrics → alerts → dashboard.
Architecture: `current-arch.md`. Running history and open issues:
`collaboration/04_CURRENT_STATE.md`.

## Hard rules

1. **Never write to production Postgres.** Use `lib.pg.read_only_snapshot()`; only `SELECT`;
   always `ROLLBACK`. Do not add any code path that opens a writable connection to
   `shaktidb_social`.
2. **No secrets in code or docs.** Credentials come from `.env` via `lib.config`. Do not
   add fallback defaults for `SHAKTI_PG_*`, and do not write hosts or passwords into
   Markdown.
3. **Never commit corpus-derived data** — DuckDB files, parquet, `UI/data/*.json`, generated
   reports, or any CSV containing post text. `.gitignore` covers these; don't force-add.
4. **Metrics v2 (`data/metrics.duckdb`) is authoritative.** `05_metrics.py` / `06_validate.py`
   and `analytics.duckdb.metrics_daily` are legacy — never base conclusions on them.
5. **Hate scores are uncalibrated** (`hate_calibrated=false`). Do not surface hate
   prevalence as a finding. Reach is a proxy — label it so.
6. **Alert on `topic_id`**, not hashtags alone (see `docs/ALERTING_KEYING.md`).
7. DuckDB is single-writer — don't run two stages that write the same `.duckdb` at once.

## News engine (additive; see `docs/NEWS_ENGINE.md`)

- Sources (`shaktidb_news` PostgreSQL, OpenSearch `full-articles`) are **read-only**: go through `lib/news_sources.py`
  only. Credentials from env (`lib/news_config.py`); never hardcode or default them.
- Dates: `published_at` only; unusable dates are excluded and counted, never replaced by scrape time. Missing = NULL, not 0.
- A historical backfill must never be started without the user's explicit approval (`backfill` needs `--i-approve-backfill`).
- Event location (GDELT ActionGeo), mentioned-in and publisher location are three separate things; never merge them.
- Pilot/backfill/incremental share one code path (`lib/news_pipeline.py`); keep it that way. Tests: `pytest scripts/tests/test_news_*.py`.

## Environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate         # pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env              # fill SHAKTI_PG_*
```

- `.venv` deliberately has **no torch/transformers**. GPU stages (`03`, `04`, `09`, `10`,
  `12`–`15`) need `PYTHONPATH` pointed at a torch-capable env; `15` and cuML paths need RAPIDS.
- If the GPU is held by vLLM, set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=` to force CPU.
- Run scripts from the repo root; `lib.config` resolves paths from its own location.

## Common commands

```bash
python scripts/07_metrics_v2.py && python scripts/08_metrics_db.py   # metrics v2
python UI/build_dashboard.py                                         # rebuild snapshot
cd UI && ../.venv/bin/python3 api_server.py 8877                     # serve dashboard
python -m pytest scripts/tests                                       # python tests
node UI/tests/check_taxonomy.mjs                                     # UI harnesses (see UI/tests/README.md)
```

## Conventions

- **Numbered scripts are pipeline stages** in run order; utilities are unnumbered.
- Every statistical primitive lives in `scripts/lib/stats_v2.py` — reuse it, don't
  reimplement NB baselines, BH-FDR, EB shrinkage or AR(1) inline. It runs self-checks; keep
  them passing.
- **Labels go through `scripts/lib/taxonomy.py`** — never hardcode category lists or display
  names in `dash.js` or the build script. Unknown categories must render with a warning,
  not be silently dropped (`UI/tests/check_taxonomy_drop.mjs` guards this).
- Platforms are derived from data (`platform_dim`), never hardcoded lists.
  `KNOWN_LOW_COVERAGE_PLATFORMS` is documentation only — don't filter on it.
- Below minimum support, emit **NULL, not 0**, and keep the support counts alongside.
- Write metric formulas into `metric_meta` / `docs/METRICS_V2_SPEC.md`; a formula change is
  a spec change.
- New stages that replace old outputs write new versioned tables (`_v2`, `_v3`) rather than
  overwriting, until the new version is verified.

## Verification expectations

This project has repeatedly found silent failures (schema drift producing zero rows,
exclusion via null timestamps, inverted null-controls, labels at <50% precision). When
changing anything:

- Check row counts and coverage before and after, per platform.
- For classifiers, hand-judge a fresh stratified sample; report precision and recall honestly.
- Record the verdict (SOUND / PARTIAL / UNSOUND) and caveats in the relevant spec and in
  `collaboration/04_CURRENT_STATE.md`.
- Run `scripts/audit_restatement.py` before adding a metric — if it just restates volume,
  it doesn't earn a column.
- After rebuilding metrics, rebuild the dashboard and run the UI harnesses.
